            <p class="lede"><a href="https://mayaontheinter.net/">Maya Man</a> (born 1996) is an artist whose practice
                centers on the tangled terrain of identity,
                performance, and the internet. According to her website she works with websites, generative systems, and
                installations to investigate how femininity, authenticity and the self are constructed in online
                culture. Her work often treats the computer screen as a site of <a
                    href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/stories/new-rules-design-maya-man">intimacy and
                    performance</a>: she regards it
                not only as a window but as a mirror, where online personas are created, curated and mediated.</p>

            <p class="caption">Maya Man’s aesthetic draws on the hyper-online: pastel gradients, social-media style
                graphics, generative combinations of found text and code. Her pieces remix
                culture-fragments—screenshots, browser tabs, comment threads—into systems that expose how repetition,
                algorithm and style shape how we present ourselves. She has exhibited <a
                    href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/maya-man">internationally</a>: her work has
                appeared at Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, at galleries and digital platforms including
                bitforms Gallery (NYC), SOOT in Tokyo, VERSE Gallery in London, HEK (Haus für Elektronische Künste) in
                Basel and in the online space of Feral File. In an interview she reflected on her background as a dancer
                and her interest in performance, saying that she was drawn to how bodies move in online spaces and how
                identities shift when mediated by screen culture.</p>

                <p class="caption">Her projects are not just explorations of aesthetic; they are also critical. In works
                    like FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT, she algorithmically recombines self-help and wellness-culture visuals
                    to show how optimism becomes a loop, a product, a style. In Glance Back she uses a browser extension
                    to capture private screenshots of the user in candid moments to make visible how the screen watches
                    us back. These concerns—about visibility, surveillance, performance, self-presentation—are central
                    to her practice.
                </p>
                <p class="caption">What makes Maya Man especially significant is how she bridges digital and physical,
                    code and critique. Her work situates internet aesthetics within gallery and institutional contexts,
                    thereby asking how the forms we habitually encounter online translate into “high art” spaces and how
                    that in turn shifts meaning. Through generative systems she shows how identity narratives circulate,
                    repeat and mutate, and invites viewers to consider whether their online selves are authored or
                    automated.
                </p>
                <p class="caption">Maya Man matters as part of a newer generation of artists who move fluidly across
                    software, browser extensions, social-media tropes and gallery installations. She reminds us that the
                    self we present online is less an individual act than part of a cultural system of style,
                    screenshot, feed and algorithm.
