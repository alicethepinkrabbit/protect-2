            <p class="lede">Maya Man (b. 1996) is a digital and generative artist whose practice spans browser
                interventions, algorithmic text-image systems, web projects, and hybrid installations. She interrogates
                notions of identity, performativity, and mediation in digital culture, especially focusing on how
                femininity, self-care, authenticity, and persona are constructed online. She frames the screen not
                merely as a passive surface but as an active site of performance and surveillance. Maya earned dual BAs
                in Computer Science and Media Studies from Pomona College, and in 2023 she completed her MFA in Media
                Art at UCLA.</p>

                browser-based works, and code-driven visual/textual hybrids. Maya On The Her homepage identifies her
                mission as exploring “identity culture on the
                Internet,” and she is represented digitally at mayaontheinter.net. Her projects often circulate in both
                web-native and institutional contexts, bridging net art, crypto/generative art, and digital art
                discourse. Through her work she addresses how screens mediate interior life, how personas are curated
                and consumed, and how our mediated environments may both reflect and distort notions of authenticity.
