            <p class="gray-box">Medium / Format: Browser extension (JavaScript), leveraging webcam capture + prompt +
                local archive. Description: The extension triggers unpredictably when a new tab opens (but only once per
                day), momentarily capturing a webcam snapshot and overlaying a prompt: “What are you thinking about?”
                The user’s typed response plus the image are stored offline in a local archive. Over time, one accrues a
                private “glance archive” of unguarded moments. Conceptual Basis: Glance Back confronts the tension
                between curated self-presentation and spontaneous “glances” of self. Because the capture is random and
                ephemeral, it resists the polished aesthetics of social media portraits. The prompt further frames a
                semi-dialogue between the user and the machine. The extension treats the computer as a gaze, instilling
                a sense of being seen, even when unguarded. This juxtaposition unsettles the boundary between
                performance and privacy in everyday digital life.Exhibitions / Presence: While Glance Back is primarily
                a live software piece, it has been discussed in digital art symposia, artist talks, and “screen walk”
                events (e.g. The Photographers’ Gallery). It may be included in code art salons or net art archives.
                Cultural / Artistic Impact: The project resonates with traditions of net art (browser as canvas) and
                relational aesthetics (the artwork as dialogue). It dialogues with ideas of self-tracking, quantified
                self, and surveillance critiques. By making the webcam flip back on the user, it flips the gaze back on
                the self. It suggests that the machine is co-author of identity. This work also dovetails with
                contemporary concerns about self-image, mental health, and the pressure of always being “on.”</p>
