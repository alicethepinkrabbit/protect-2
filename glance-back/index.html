                <p>Maya Man’s project <a href="https://glanceback.info">Glance Back</a> takes the computer screen—from
                    which so much of our
                    identity now emerges—as both site and subject, asking what it means when your device turns the gaze
                    back
                    on you. The tool is distributed as a browser extension; at a random moment once per day, when the
                    user
                    opens a new tab, the extension snaps a candid photograph of the user, prompts them with the question
                    “What are you thinking about?”, and then stores both the image and the text response in an archive
                    on
                    the user’s local machine.</p>
                <p>What stands out in Glance Back is its interrogation of the polished self-image that dominates social
                    media. Instead of asking the user to post another perfect selfie or stage a curated moment, the
                    extension captures a moment when the user is — whether aware of it or not — encountering their
                    screen. Maya Man describes it as an antidote to stereotyped “<a
                        href="https://medium.com/the-link-art-blocks/in-conversation-with-maya-man-fa80839c852e">posed</a>”
                    online imagery: the photograph
                    need not be flattering, the user need not share it publicly; it is just a record between them and
                    their machine.</p>
                <p>Because the archive is stored locally and not expected to be shared, the project shifts the
                    relationship between user and device. The computer, often seen as a passive tool for consumption or
                    broadcasting, becomes an interlocutor: it silently watches and prompts a response. The architecture
                    of the extension also evokes the algorithmic gaze that defines so much of our online existence.
                    Glance Back flips the gaze back, exposing how we are being seen while we consume or produce content.
                </p>
                <p>n terms of influence and significance, Glance Back resonates for a number of reasons. First, it
                    engages with themes of surveillance, self-image and the behind-the-scenes of digital identity: by
                    forcing a candid moment, the project highlights how “<a
                        href="https://medium.com/the-link-art-blocks/in-conversation-with-maya-man-fa80839c852e">authenticity</a>”
                    itself is often mediated by
                    technology and expectation. Second, the work underscores the idea that the boundary between
                    performance and everyday life is thinning when so much of our time is spent interacting with
                    screens. Third, its format—a simple Chrome extension—demonstrates how accessible tools can become
                    platforms for critical reflection. The project has gathered thousands of users, creating a
                    distributed archive of screened selves that, while private, constitute a collective practice of
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>Finally, Glance Back matters because it invites users to pause: to look at the moment when the screen
                    opens, when a new tab appears, when the machine asks you “what are you thinking about?” It asks
                    whether you’re simply consuming, or whether you’re aware of how you’re being observed—or observing
                    yourself. In a culture of endless sharing and curated identity, Glance Back offers a slow, quiet
                    interruption—a moment for you and your screen to meet.</p>
