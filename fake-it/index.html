                Maya Man’s project Fake It Till You Make It explores the glossy and exaggerated optimism of online
                self-help culture. Using generative art as her medium, Man captures how the visual language of social
                media has turned personal growth into a performance. The project began in 2022 as a collection of 700
                digital works on Art Blocks and quickly grew into a larger body of work that includes a physical book,
                website, and exhibition titled “Gift Shop.” Each version of the project expands the same central idea:
                how images of empowerment, motivation, and positivity can easily become hollow repetitions of
                themselves.

                The artwork uses custom JavaScript code to recreate and remix Instagram’s aesthetic of pink gradients,
                sparkles, and motivational slogans. Man gathered hundreds of examples from real posts and translated
                them into arrays of phrases, adjectives, and sentence structures. The program then combines these
                fragments into random messages such as “Repeat, overthink, obsess” or “You’re sad and you deserve a
                scary life.” Each text is placed on bright, decorative backgrounds labeled with names like “Wavy Baby,”
                “Glossy Block,” and “Main Character Energy.” The result is an infinite stream of images that look
                familiar yet unsettling, revealing how algorithmic logic shapes the tone of online self-expression.

                In interviews, Man described her inspiration as the “sugar-cookie aesthetic world of girl-power
                positive-vibes boss-babe media.” Her work does not reject that world entirely but exposes its
                contradictions. It celebrates the visual beauty of those digital graphics while revealing how quickly
                they become standardized and emotionless. The project can theoretically produce over eighty billion
                combinations of text and image, which mirrors how the internet continually generates new content that
                feels original but is built from the same templates.

                Fake It Till You Make It questions what happens when language about healing and ambition loses meaning
                through repetition. It asks whether slogans that promise transformation actually help people or simply
                feed the same market that sells optimism as a lifestyle. Critics such as Kat Kitay have pointed out that
                the project’s “gift-shop” merchandise, which includes thongs and keychains, makes it part of the same
                consumer cycle it critiques. This contradiction is intentional. By reproducing the very system it
                examines, the work becomes a self-portrait of digital culture’s endless loop of irony and sincerity.

                The influence of Man’s project reaches beyond internet art. In the field of generative design, it stands
                as a clear example of code functioning not only as a tool but as a form of commentary. Scholars studying
                digital identity have connected her work to discussions of “digital girlhood” and “girlboss” culture,
                showing how people construct and monetize their identities through algorithmic systems. The translation
                of this online project into printed books and gallery installations demonstrates how net-based art can
                exist both on and off the screen, while still reflecting on the same cultural forces.

                Ultimately, Fake It Till You Make It captures the strange intersection of sincerity and performance in
                the age of the internet. It reminds viewers that the cheerful graphics encouraging self-belief often
                serve the logic of visibility rather than genuine empowerment. By allowing code to imitate this culture
                endlessly, Man exposes how the language of positivity has become automated. Her project asks whether we
                are still expressing ourselves online or simply repeating what the algorithm wants us to say. Through
                humor and discomfort, she invites us to notice the machinery behind every message of motivation.
