                Medium / Format: Generative JavaScript algorithm, minted as NFTs (Art Blocks); printed book; physical
                “merch” incarnations; installations. It consists of 700 unique NFTs.Description: The system scrapes or
                aggregates text-graphic tropes from social media (especially inspirational / wellness graphic memes) and
                remixes them via algorithm into pastel-gradient images with overlaid phrases. Some outputs are
                recognizably derivative of motivational rhetoric (“You are enough,” “Believe in yourself”) while others
                subvert or rewrite them ironically (e.g. “REPEAT, OVERTHINK, OBSESS”). The project exists across
                digital, object, and spatial modalities: you can generate new images, browse past editions in the book,
                or encounter physical artifacts in a gift shop scenario. Conceptual Basis: The project interrogates how
                social media languages (affirmations, self-help graphics, “girl boss” tropes) reify norms of positivity,
                productivity, and self-optimization. By algorithmically remixing these tropes, Maya Man questions
                sincerity vs. simulacrum, co-option vs. resistance. The work speaks to how motivational language becomes
                commodified and flattening, while raising questions about agency within generative systems. Exhibitions
                / Versions: The original NFT drop on Art Blocks during Miami Art Week 2022. The FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT book was published by Heavy Manners Library in 2024,
                collecting ~700 editions, essays, code, etc. A “Gift Shop” installation
                (Feb–Mar 2024, Los Angeles) turned outputs into physical merch (stickers, apparel, prints) mixing
                commerce and critique. bitforms gallery+1; Related solo and group exhibitions around code art, wellness
                critique, and digital aesthetics. Cultural / Artistic Impact: FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT has catalyzed
                discourse on the limits of irony in digital critique. In The Brooklyn Rail, Kat Kitay argues that while
                the project critiques “digital girlhood,” it sometimes reproduces the very clichés it lampoons. Some view it as ironic, others see it as complicity. The project sits in lineage with artists who
                adopt “digital girl” aesthetics (Molly Soda, Petra Cortright, Ann Hirsch). It also participates in the
                generative / algorithmic art movement, where aesthetics are co-produced with code, not simply
                represented. Its hybrid form (digital → book → merch) demonstrates how net art is evolving to cross
                media boundaries.
