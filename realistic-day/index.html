    <p>Maya Man’s work A Realistic Day In My Life Living In New York City operates in the space between lived experience
      and curated performance, drawing on one of the most pervasive formats of social-media culture: the “day in my
      life” video. The piece was commissioned by the <a
        href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/maya-man?">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> for its online art platform
      artport
      and launched on 29 October 2024.
      Across every full hour of the day the work displays a quote drawn from public short-form videos on TikTok in which
      creators structure their content around specific times: “Pilates at 7:00, went home, changed, quick breakfast…”
      (for example) appears large in bold pink font on <a
        href="https://whitneymedia.org/assets/generic_file/4051/Maya_Man_-_On_the_Hour_Project_Announcement.pdf?">whitney.org</a>
      at exactly 7:00 am.After each quoted hour-marker, the
      screen fills with animated responses from the original video comments section, thus layering viewer reaction onto
      the fragment of “<a
        href="https://ocula.com/institutions/whitney-museum-of-american-art/exhibitions/a-realistic-day-in-my-life-living-in-new-york-city/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">real
        life</a>” time.
      By stripping the visual elements of the videos and isolating the text referencing times of day, Maya Man exposes
      how the genre of “realistic day” content builds authenticity through scheduling, performative markers, and
      social-media syntax. The descriptor “realistic” appears frequently in video titles as a cue to the viewer: “what
      you do in a day ♥ realistic” and similar tags signal a promise of un-filtered, relatable life. Her work suggests
      that what passes for relatable life online is already highly edited, timed and formatted.

      The piece invites reflection on the blurred boundary between living and staging: everyday tasks become content,
      creators become performers of their own day, and the viewer becomes audience to a constructed schedule. Because
      each hour is tied to a textual fragment from real videos, the work maps the rhythms of social-media attention
      rather than the private life of the creator. The aesthetic of large hour-markers and pink typography mimics the
      swagger of internet-native design while the underlying logic reads as critique of how mundane time-based content
      is consumed.
      In terms of influence, this work contributes to conversations around digital identity, performativity and the
      architecture of attention online. By embedding itself in the institutional context of the Whitney’s artport, it
      also underscores how internet-native forms can be appropriated into gallery or museum settings, thus bridging
      platforms and institutions. It further offers artists and scholars a compelling case study in how time, text, and
      algorithm-adjacent formats function as cultural models in the age of short-form video. It points to the
      implications of self-tracking, content scheduling, and the quantification of lived experience for the attention
      economy.
      Ultimately, A Realistic Day In My Life Living In New York City resonates because it asks its audience: is this
      real life or a formatted life? Who frames our hours, and who watches them? Maya Man takes the mundane and
      aestheticizes it, then turns it inside out to reveal how much of our “day” is already a constructed spectacle.</p>
