    <p>In her digital-commissioned work A Realistic Day In My Life Living In New York City (2024), the artist Maya Man
      confronts the intersection of everyday life, social-media performance, and digital authenticity. The piece was
      commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of its “On the Hour” series and unfolds as text-based
      snippets that appear on the museum’s web-platform at the top of each hour.
      Formal structure and method
      At first glance, the work is deceptively minimal: on each full hour, for thirty seconds, the museum’s website
      displays a line of text extracted from publicly posted TikTok “day in my life” videos — for example, “Pilates at
      7:00, went home…” — followed by a cascade of animated comments drawn from the source videos.
      By stripping away the original visuals and transforming a scrolling social-media feed into a timed
      web-installation, Man highlights how the “realistic day” format is inherently performative, yet stands in cultural
      claim of spontaneity and authenticity.
      Themes of authenticity, performance, and digital life
      One core tension of the piece lies in how the “day in my life” genre seeks to present mundane, quotidian
      experience while simultaneously crafting a narrative amenable to attention economy. By labeling content
      “realistic,” creators signal that what we are seeing is unfiltered, relatable, and genuine. Yet Man unpacks this
      claim: she shows that even the most “everyday” moments are framed, edited, scheduled, and ultimately deployed for
      public consumption.
      Furthermore, the hourly rhythm of the presentation turns life into a metronome: a moment in time becomes a slot
      for representation. Viewers encounter not the person behind the life but a curated slice of an online identity.
      The comments that flood the screen remind us of the peers, spectators, and algorithmic audiences who sit behind
      each post — consuming, endorsing, critiquing. The effect is both uncanny and familiar: the “real” is filtered
      through layers of performance, commentary, and digital formatting.
      Critical implications
      Man’s work raises several compelling questions. First: what is “realistic” in the age of social media? The piece
      suggests that authenticity has become another aesthetic option, something you choose rather than something you
      simply live. Second: where is the boundary between living and broadcasting? By introducing the institutional
      web-site of a major museum as the host, Man bridges high art and everyday digital display, suggesting that our
      lives are increasingly always on stage. Third: what is the role of the audience? The comments are not passive—they
      are active parts of the representation. The work asks whether we are mere witnesses to someone’s life or whether
      we silently participate in shaping it.
      Context and relevance
      Given that Man’s broader practice explores internet identity, algorithmic behaviour and what she calls “the
      manufacture of subjectivity,” this piece sits at a nexus of contemporary concerns: our self-presentation online,
      micro-trends, and the scaffolding of digital platforms.
      Being displayed on the Whitney’s site further signals how digital vernacular culture—once dismissed as trivial—has
      entered the institutional art space, opening new dialogues about medium, attention and agency.
      Conclusion
      In “A Realistic Day…”, Maya Man gives us a mirror: one that reflects our own scrolling habits, our own desires for
      the “authentic,” and our complicity in shaping the image of an ordinary day. By removing the façade of polished
      video and presenting only text and commentary, she casts into relief the mechanics behind our seemingly
      spontaneous digital interactions. The work is both a critique and an elegy for the everyday as it is consumed,
      performed, and globalised through screens.</p>
